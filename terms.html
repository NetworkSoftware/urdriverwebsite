                <p class="sub-head">2. SERVICES DESCRIPTION:</p>
                <p>1. UrDriver Services Private Limited operates a technology based electronic platform service
                    called ‘UrDriver’ which seeks to provide drivers-on-demand to customers who wish to obtain the
                    services of a driver.</p>
                <p>2. UrDriver enables the hiring of drivers by commuters/ passengers for a point to point pick up and
                    drop off Service, within city limits and outside city limits, through the Application in mobile
                    telecommunications devices and through the Website. The Service is designed to offer you information
                    and a means of obtaining short-term private driver solutions to coordinate point-to-point and
                    round-trip private driver services, at user’s request. As a User, you authorize the opted Driver to
                    operate your vehicle and make decisions on your behalf during a period of time designated by you.
                </p>
                <p>3. The Drivers offering their services on the UrDriver platform are individuals and independent
                    service
                    providers who have opted to enlist themselves with UrDriver. The drivers are screened and trained
                    prior to being listed as a driver on the UrDriver platform. At no point can the driver represent
                    himself to be an employee of UrDriver Services Private Limited/UrDriver. The user terms and
                    conditions in here expressly provide that the drivers are independent service providers and are not
                    employees of UrDriver Services Private Limited/UrDriver.</p>
                <p>4. Further, it is to be noted that UrDriver, in itself does not provide driving / transportation
                    services. The customer offers the mode of transportation. The terms and conditions clearly state
                    that the provision of services by the driver to the customer is, subject to the agreement entered
                    into between them and UrDriver shall under no circumstance be a party to such agreement.</p>
                <p>5. To elaborate, the modus operandi is as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <p>a. ‘UrDriver’ aims at bringing drivers/operators (service providers) and customers owning private
                        cars on a common platform by which the said customers can place a request for the services of a
                        professional driver for commute.</p>
                    <p>b. The e-commerce platform brings the customer into contact with a driver so as to avail the
                        latter’s services, subject to the availability of drivers in or around the customer’s location
                        at the time of registering his request.</p>
                    <p>c. The request by the customer could be for a point-to-point commute or a round trip is placed by
                        the customer electronically over a mobile based app or through an online website operated by
                        UrDriver or via phone service.</p>
                    <p>d. Towards the end of the commute, the customers are charged for the services of the driver,
                        which is intimated to them over the app or mail. The services may be paid for by the customers
                        either:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>in cash, directly to the driver or </li>
                        <li>through online payment options, to UrDriver </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>e. Where the customer opts to pay for the drivers’ services through any of the online modes
                        available on the app, UrDriver remits the proceeds collected from the customers to the
                        respective
                        drivers.</p>
                    <p>f. In return for the use of the UrDriver’s electronic platform, the Drivers are charged a
                        convenience fee by UrDriver. UrDriver remits any applicable tax to the credit of the respective
                        Governments and regularly files periodic returns as prescribed under the GST laws.</p>
                </ul>
                <p class="sub-head">3. USE OF SERVICE, APPLICATION AND WEBSITE:</p>
                <p>The Application and the Website allows you to send a request for Service to a Driver. The GPS
                    receiver, which should be installed on the mobile device (smart phone) on which you have downloaded
                    the Application or the Website, shall detect your location and shall send your location information
                    to the relevant Driver. UrDriver has sole and complete discretion to accept or reject each request
                    for
                    providing the Service. UrDriver also has sole and complete discretion over whether to use the
                    Application / Website to receive the leads generated through the Application / Website. If UrDriver
                    accepts a request, the Application / Website notifies you and provides information regarding the
                    Driver - including his name and the ability to contact the Driver by telephone or a message. The
                    Application / Website also allow you to view the Driver’s progress towards the pick-up point, in
                    real time.</p>
                <p>UrDriver shall undertake commercially reasonable efforts to bring you into contact with a Driver in
                    order to avail the Services, subject to the availability of Drivers in or around your location at
                    the moment of your request for the Services.</p>
                <p>UrDriver itself does not provide transportation services. It is up to the User to offer
                    transportation.
                    UrDriver only acts as intermediary between the Driver and you. The provision of the Services by the
                    Driver to you is, therefore, subject to the agreement (to be) entered into between the Driver and
                    you. UrDriver shall under no circumstance be a party to such agreement. UrDriver disclaims any and
                    all
                    liability in respect of the Drivers including any claims of employment or any vicarious liability
                    arising out of the Service or otherwise.</p>
